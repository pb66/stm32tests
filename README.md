# stm32tests

this repo is just some notes gathered whilst starting out with an STM32 MCU, in particular a nucleo-f303re board.

For notes about any particular project check for a README.md in that project's folder.

## Getting started

## Using Make

To compile and flash the firmware to a USB connected device and then view the serial output on a Linux box all that is required is the arm toolchain and a serial console like Minicom, both can be installed via apt-get

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi minicom
```

once this repo is cloned or downloaded/extracted a project can be compiled by just running `make` from the chosen project folder

```
git clone https://github.com/stm32oem/stm32tests.git
cd stm32tests/emonTxshield
make
```

to flash the firmware to a USB connected nucleo board using the on-board STLink v2.1 programmer/debugger, the `.bin` file found in the `build` folder that was generated by `make` can be copied to the "NODE_F303RE" USB storage device. The STLink v2.1 makes flashing very easy by presenting the nucleo board as a USB mass storage device (512Kb in the case of the F303RE) and any `.bin` file dropped there will be flashed to the target STM32 MCU by the STLink v2.1 automatiaclly.

```
cp build/emonTxshield.bin /media/pi/NODE_F303RE
```

The path to the "NODE_F303RE" may vary depending on the host OS in use. Here Raspbian Stretch is being used an a Raspberry Pi 3 and it was autodetected and mounted by the OS.

Minicom can be used to view the serial output.
```
minicom -F -b115200 -D/dev/ttyACM0
```
if the serial output scrolls off the right hand side of the page, the "Add carriage return" setting in Minicom can be set with `ctrl-a` then `u`. to exit Minicom use `ctrl-a` then `x` and `enter` or to bring up a menu of options `ctrl-a` then `z`.

to make life a little easier an alias can be set up with
```
printf "alias nucleo='minicom  -F -b115200 -D/dev/ttyACM0'\n" >> ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bashrc
```
so that just typing `nucleo` will open Minicom with the correct path and baud eg
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nucleo

```
Likewise we can add a bash function to help with uploading too with
```
printf 'function flash() { cp "build/${PWD##*/}.bin" "/media/${USER}/NODE_F303RE" ; }\n' >> ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bashrc
```
The line may need editing for some setups, it currently uses the current working directory to workout the `.bin` filename and assumes the nucleo is mounted in the current users media folder.

Now just typing `flash` will copy the `.bin` file to the nucleo board. So to compile, upload and open minicom in one move.
```
make && flash && nucleo
```
this has an added advantage that it actually catches the resetting of the nucleo so you see the full startup info of the newly flashed FW

### For the less patient (including me) here is an all in one block of code

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi minicom
printf "alias nucleo='minicom -F -b115200 -D/dev/ttyACM0'\n" >> ~/.bash_aliases
printf 'function flash() { cp "build/${PWD##*/}.bin" "/media/${USER}/NODE_F303RE" ; }\n' >> ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/stm32oem/stm32tests.git
cd stm32tests/emonTxshield
make
flash
nucleo
```
[this works on a Pi running Raspbian Stretch, you may get different results if (for example) the `git` and `make` packages are not already installed. Omit the first lines if tools already installed or the last lines if nucleo device not yet connected]



## Alternatively to use platformIO

Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) users should **always** use sudo to install platformio and generally **never** use sudo when using any platformio or pio commands, **ever!**

Install platformio http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html#local-download-mac-linux-windows

To download this repo, compile and upload with platformIO:

```
git clone https://github.com/stm32oem/stm32tests.git
cd stm32tests/emonTxshield
pio run -t upload
```

To view serial output:

`pio device monitor`

[Note - For more info see the [STM32 PlatformIO](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/stm32-platformio/7015?u=pb66) thread on OEM forum.]
